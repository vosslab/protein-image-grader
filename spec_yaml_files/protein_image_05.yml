        '*2hhb*':
            point_deduction: -0.4
            feedback: 'please enter common name; not the PDB id. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*human*':
            point_deduction: -0.1
            feedback: 'The organism name is not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*protoporphyrin*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'any bound ligands like protoporphyrin is not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*transport*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'Please provice the common enzyme name, not its classification. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'Hemoglobin is an important oxygen transport protein. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'

  - name: "Mutated amino acid"
    csv_column: 9 #note starts at column 1, not 0
    type: mc
    answer: 'Valine'
    point_deduction: -0.2
    feedback: 'The mutated valine (Val) amino acid causes hemoglobin proteins to aggregate via the hydrophobic effect.'

  - name: "Wildtype amino acid"
    csv_column: 10 #note starts at column 1, not 0
    type: mc
    answer: 'Glutamate'
    point_deduction: -0.2
    feedback: 'The wildtype glutamate (Glu) amino acid is charged and prevents protein aggregation.'

image_questions:
    - name: "Image was received"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -1
      feedback: 'no image submitted'

    - name: "Protein PDB ID is correct"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -3
      feedback: 'this protein was not the one that was assigned, be sure to use the correct for ths protein image. Most often students upload the image from a previous assignment.'

    - name: "alpha subunits have different color than beta subunits"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the alpha subunits a different color than the beta subunits. Your image does not have this color distinction.'

    - name: "subunits have two colors, not four"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the alpha subunits a different color than the beta subunits. There are two alpha and two beta subunits, so I should only see two different colors. Your image colored all four subunits in different colors, but each of the alpha subunits should have the same color as each other, as well as the beta subunits.'

    - name: "the heme coenzyme has a different color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the heme coenzyme a different color. Your image did not have this.'

    - name: "Some amino acid has a distinct color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the amino acids that are mutated in sickle cell anemia a different color. Specifically the amino acid is valine at position 6 on the beta chain. Your image did not have this.'

    - name: "Exactly two amino acids have a distinct color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the amino acids that are mutated in sickle cell anemia a different color. Specifically, the amino acid is valine at position 6 on both of the beta chains. That is one amino acid (1) for each of the two beta chains (2) = a total of 1x2 = 2 amino acids should be colored. Your image colored either too many or too few amino acids.'

    - name: "Specifically amino acid 6 in the beta subunit has a distinct color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the amino acids that are mutated in sickle cell anemia a different color. Specifically the amino acid is valine at position 6 on the beta chain. Your image did not have the correct amino acid.'

    - name: "White background was used"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'one of the main criteria is to have a white background, try using Preset->Publication 1 for an easy fix.'

    - name: "Crisp edges, no green halo from selection tool"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'next time try to de-select all atoms before taking the image or you get a green halo'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, not too small"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'your protein image does not fill the image, next time zoom in to fill the image and avoid too much white space.'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, entire protein fits in frame and not cutoff"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'your protein image is zoomed in too far and it is cutting off important details, zoom out more next time.'

    - name: "File type is PNG, not JPEG or something else"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'The assignment is to export the image as a PNG file. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'

    - name: "PNG image export was used, not a screenshot"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'it looks like you used a screen shot instead of exporting the image, the assignment to export the image it is of higher quality. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'
