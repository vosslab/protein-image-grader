        '*1ppi*':
            point_deduction: -0.4
            feedback: 'please enter common name; not the PDB id. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*mammalian*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'The organism name is not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*pancreatic*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'The organ source name is not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*carbohydrate*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'any bound ligands like carbohydrates are not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'Amylase is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch into sugars. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'

image_questions:
    - name: "Image was received"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -1
      feedback: 'no image submitted'

    - name: "Protein PDB ID is correct"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -3
      feedback: 'this protein was not the one that was assigned, be sure to use the correct for ths protein image. Most often students upload the image from a previous assignment.'

    - name: "the starch substrate has a bright color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the starch substrate a bright color. Your image did not have this.'

    - name: "both starch substrates have a bright color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color both of the starch substrate a bright color. Your image only had one strach colored.'

    - name: "only starch substrates have a bright color and not something else"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color both of the starch substrate a bright color. Your image only had something else colored brightly.'

    - name: "the bright colored ligand stands out from the protein"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to color the starch ligand a bright color so that it stands out from the protein. While your image may have a bright colored starch ligand, it does not stand out.'

    - name: "White background was used"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'one of the main criteria is to have a white background, try using Preset->Publication 1 for an easy fix.'

      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'next time try to de-select all atoms before taking the image or you get a green halo'

      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'your protein image does not fill the image, next time zoom in to fill the image and avoid too much white space.'

    - name: "Entire protein is visible, nothing is cut off or missing."
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'your protein image is zoomed in too far and it is cutting off important details, zoom out more next time.'

    - name: "PNG image export was used, not a screenshot"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'it looks like you used a screen shot instead of exporting the image, the assignment to export the image it is of higher quality. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'

      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0.0
      feedback: 'It appears that you uploaded the exact same image as another student. While you are welcome to work with other students, you must create your own independent image. Next time you will lose points'
