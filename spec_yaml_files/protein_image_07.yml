        '*1ehz*':
            point_deduction: -0.4
            feedback: 'please enter common name; not the PDB id. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        '*yeast*':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'The organism name is not part of the enzyme name. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'
        'phenylalanine':
            point_deduction: -0.2
            feedback: 'Phenylalanine is an amino acid, not a protein structure. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'

            feedback: 'Transfer RNA is an adaptor molecule that connects mRNA and amino acid sequence. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'

                point_deduction: -0.2
                feedback: 'The Genus species of the organism was Saccharmomyces cerevisiae, accept no substitutes'

    - name: "Two ions"
      csv_column: 10 #note starts at column 1, not 0
      type: ma
      answer: 'Magnesium;Manganese'
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'The PDB website listed Mg and Mn, which are Magnesium and Manganese.'

    - name: "Ion charge"
      csv_column: 11 #note starts at column 1, not 0
      type: mc
      answer: 'positive +2'
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'Magnesium and Manganese both have a +2 positive charge in water. The positive charge helps cancel out the charge from the negative charge of the phosphate backbone in the RNA.'

image_questions:
    - name: "Image was received"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -1
      feedback: 'no image submitted'

    - name: "Protein PDB ID is correct"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -3
      feedback: 'this protein was not the one that was assigned, be sure to use the correct for ths protein image. Most often students upload the image from a previous assignment.'

    - name: "tRNA is oriented like Greek letter gamma"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to orient the tRNA like Greek letter gamma. Your image does not have this correct.'

    - name: "anti-codon on bottom and CCA tail on right"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to orient the tRNA with the anti-codon on bottom and CCA tail on right. Your image does not have this correct.'

    - name: "base pairing between strands is clearly visible"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to make sure to show base pairing between strands. Your image does not have this clearly visible.'

    - name: "Unique color"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to give the molecule a unique color, but your image is just the default color.'

    - name: "White background was used"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'one of the main criteria is to have a white background, try using Preset->Publication 1 for an easy fix.'

    - name: "Crisp edges, no green halo from selection tool"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'next time try to de-select all atoms before taking the image or you get a green halo'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, not too small"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'your protein image does not fill the image, next time zoom in to fill the image and avoid too much white space.'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, entire protein fits in frame and not cutoff"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'your protein image is zoomed in too far and it is cutting off important details, zoom out more next time.'

    - name: "File type is PNG, not JPEG or something else"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'The assignment is to export the image as a PNG file. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'

    - name: "PNG image export was used, not a screenshot"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'it looks like you used a screen shot instead of exporting the image, the assignment to export the image it is of higher quality. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'
