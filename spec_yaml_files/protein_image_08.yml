            feedback: 'please enter common name; not the PDB id. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein. You can usually find it within the PDB structure name, but it might not be obvious which words are correct.'

            feedback: 'Kcsa stands for K+ channel of streptomyces A, which not while wrong is not ideal. Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein.

Unfortunately, there is no true formula for finding the protein common name, so it might require some background reading on the protein.

image_questions:
    - name: "Image was received ##"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -1
      feedback: 'no image submitted'

    - name: "Protein PDB ID is correct"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -3
      feedback: 'this protein was not the one that was assigned, be sure to use the correct for ths protein image. Most often students upload the image from a previous assignment.'

    - name: "Top down view of the channel"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to orient the membrane protein in to top down view of the channel. Your image does not have this correct.'

    - name: "Unique color for each subunit"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to give each subunit a unique color, all of yours are the same color'

    - name: "Unique color overall"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'Part of the assignment was to give the molecule a unique color, but your image is just the default color.'

    - name: "White background was used"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'one of the main criteria is to have a white background, try using Preset->Publication 1 for an easy fix.'

    - name: "Crisp edges, no green halo from selection tool"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'next time try to de-select all atoms before taking the image or you get a green halo'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, not too small"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.2
      feedback: 'your protein image does not fill the image, next time zoom in to fill the image and avoid too much white space.'

    - name: "Zoom level is good, entire protein fits in frame and not cutoff"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: 0
      feedback: 'your protein image is zoomed in too far and it is cutting off important details, zoom out more next time.'

    - name: "File type is PNG, not JPEG or something else"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.1
      feedback: 'The assignment is to export the image as a PNG file. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'

    - name: "PNG image export was used, not a screenshot"
      type: bool
      point_deduction: -0.3
      feedback: 'it looks like you used a screen shot instead of exporting the image, the assignment to export the image it is of higher quality. Watch the YouTube videos again for the how-to.'
